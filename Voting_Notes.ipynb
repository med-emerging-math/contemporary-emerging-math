    "One thing you may have noticed is that the different methods take varying amounts of time to actually compute. The plurality method is fairly quick to compute, but the Borda count method involves counting many more things. Our first step is to make this more precise and introduce some helpful notions.\n",

    "So in step 2, for each candidate we will need to make `number_of_ballots(n)` many additions. Since there are $n$ candidates, in total step 2 will take $n \\times$ `number_of_ballots(n)` many additions. \n",

To complete step 3 we need to translate each of these entries to their corresponding number of Borda points. For example, each first place vote should award $n$ points. Since we need to make a multiplication for each entry in this table, we will need to make $n \\times n$ many multiplications in step 3.\n",

    "2. **The Condorcet criterion**. If candidate X is preferred by the voters over each of the other candidates in a head-to-head comparison, then candidate X should be the winner of the election.\n",
    "3. **The monotonicity criterion**. If candidate X is a winner of an election and, in a reelection, the only changes in the ballots are changes that favour X (and only X), then X should remain a winner in the election.\n",
    "4. **The independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives criterion (IIA)**. If candidate X is a winner of an election and in a recount one of the *nonwinning* candidates withdraws or is disqualified, then X should still be a winner of the election.\n",

    "## 2.3 - Arrow's Impossibility Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by reading the Conclusion section of Chapter 1 in the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrow's impossibility theorem (dictator version)\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of Arrow's Impossibility theorem presented in the textbook is this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem** (Textbook version). It is mathematically impossible for a voting system to satisfy all four of the fairness criteria we discussed: the Majority criteria, the Condorcet Criterion, the Monotonicity criterion, and IIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another version of this theorem which is more commonly called \"Arrow's impossibility theorem\". Since it's the more common one, we'll introduce it here, but we won't spend too much time with it. To introduce it we need two new notions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Unanimity Criterion**. If all voters prefer candidate A to candidate B, then the voting system ranks candidate A above candidate B.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dictator**. A dictator is a person whose ballot is always the outcome of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can state the classic version of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. One major difference is that it concerns voting systems that *ranks* all the candidates, not just ones that merely produce a winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem** (Dictator version). Every voting system that ranks all the candidates that satisfies IIA and the Unanimity criterion must contain a dictator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do rules interact with each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting thing about these theorems is that they are able to say something about all possible voting systems at once, not just about specific systems. This theorem is really about how *properties* or *fairness criteria* interact and relate to each other. While this may feel strange at first, we have some familiarity with how properties interact. For example, in the world of numbers we know that the property \"n is even\" is incompatible with \"n is odd\", but the property \"n is a multiple of 6\" guarantees that \"n is even\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships are more complicated in Arrow's theorem, but we will show an example of how properties can interact and how to establish those facts. These arguments are different from showing that a particular voting system (like the Borda Count method) does or does not have a property. We argue that one property is related to another one, *for every system*. In exercise 1 below you will see this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that if a system satisfies the Condorcet criterion, then it must also satisfy the Majority criterion. (Hint: Show that if a candidate has the majority of first place votes, then they must also be the Condorcet candidate.)\n",
    "2. Give an example of a voting system that satisfies the Majority criterion, but not the Condorcet criterion.\n",
    "3. Discuss the validility of the following interpretation of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem: \"The only fair decision-making system is a dictatorship\"."
