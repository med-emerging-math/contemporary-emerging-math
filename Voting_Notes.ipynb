For example, imagine that the entire population of the earth ranked every person in the world to determine the world's greatest cook. What is the most number of unique ballots that could occur?

    "While investigating voting systems last week we looked at properties systems can have that capture various notions of fairness. In this lecture we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review the four criteria.\n",
    "* Review what it means for criteria to be violated.\n",
    "* How do we find data sets that show a criteria is violated?\n",

    "### Review of the four fairness criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "To review, we looked at these four fairness criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The majority criterion**. If candidate X has a majority of the first place votes, then candidate X should be the winner of the election.\n",
    "2. **The Condorcet criterion**. If candidate X is preferred by the voters over each of the other candidates in a head-to-head comparison, then candidate X should be the winner of the election.\n",
    "3. **The monotonicity criterion**. If candidate X is a winner of an election and, in a reelection, the only changes in the ballots are changes that favour X (and only X), then X should remain a winner in the election.\n",
    "4. **The independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives criterion (IIA)**. If candidate X is a winner of an election and in a recount one of the *nonwinning* candidates withdraws or is disqualified, then X should still be a winner of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voting systems can have some of these and not others. **Exercise**. To help remember what we've covered so far, fill in the following table of information by replacing `False` with `True` in the relevant spots. Use the examples in the textbook to help you. (If you're desperate for the answers, they are contained in the conclusion section of the textbook.)"

    "\n",
    "Start by reading the Conclusion section of Chapter 1 in the textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrow's impossibility theorem (dictator version)\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of Arrow's Impossibility theorem presented in the textbook is this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem** (Textbook version). It is mathematically impossible for a voting system to satisfy all four of the fairness criteria we discussed: the Majority criteria, the Condorcet Criterion, the Monotonicity criterion, and IIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another version of this theorem which is more commonly called \"Arrow's impossibility theorem\". Since it's the more common one, we'll introduce it here, but we won't spend too much time with it. To introduce it we need two new notions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Unanimity Criterion**. If all voters prefer candidate A to candidate B, then the voting system ranks candidate A above candidate B.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dictator**. A dictator is a person whose ballot is always the outcome of the election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can state the classic version of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. One major difference is that it concerns voting systems that *ranks* all the candidates, not just ones that merely produce a winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem** (Dictator version). Every voting system that ranks all the candidates that satisfies IIA and the Unanimity criterion must contain a dictator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do rules interact with each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting thing about these theorems is that they are able to say something about all possible voting systems at once, not just about specific systems. This theorem is really about how *properties* or *fairness criteria* interact and relate to each other. While this may feel strange at first, we have some familiarity with how properties interact. For example, in the world of numbers we know that the property \"n is even\" is incompatible with \"n is odd\", but the property \"n is a multiple of 6\" guarantees that \"n is even\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationships are more complicated in Arrow's theorem, but we will show an example of how properties can interact and how to establish those facts. These arguments are different from showing that a particular voting system (like the Borda Count method) does or does not have a property. We argue that one property is related to another one, *for every system*. In exercise 1 below you will see this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that if a system satisfies the Condorcet criterion, then it must also satisfy the Majority criterion. (Hint: Show that if a candidate has the majority of first place votes, then they must also be the Condorcet candidate.)\n",
    "2. Give an example of a voting system that satisfies the Majority criterion, but not the Condorcet criterion.\n",
    "3. Discuss the validility of the following interpretation of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem: \"The only fair decision-making system is a dictatorship\"."
