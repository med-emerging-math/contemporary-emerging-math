# 3.2 Brute Force and Greedy Algorithms

In Chapters 6.4 and 6.5 we learned two algorithms for solving Taveling Salesman problems (TSPs): the Exhaustive Method (or the Brute-Force method) and the "Go Cheap" method (the nearest-neighbour method). These two methods have traits that are applicable to other problems. 

In most optimization problems, there is an exact, but innefficent method (the Brute Force method), and there is often an inexact but efficient method (the Greedy algorithm). We will look at both of these today.

## 1. Brute Force

Think about the following types of optimization problems:
